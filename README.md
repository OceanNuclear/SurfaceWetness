# SurfaceWetness
Collate weather monitoring API data to calculate wether today is suitable for outdoor sports.

## Context
For context, this request stemmed from a need to monitor surface wetness to know when I can do all my outdoor sports. Since the rain in England doesn't dry up easily, and I do various sports that requires the surface to be dry enough for use, i.e. cycling and longboarding, that requires the ground to not be completely waterlogged and splash mud all over my trousers.
