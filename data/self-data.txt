# The options are: paving, fine, coarse, gravel
# "paving" includes more delicate roads including concrete driveways and
#   paved sidewalks paved in paving-slab patterns, or are made out of bricks.
#   It is not uncommon to have mud and vegetation accumulated in the larger gaps in these patterns.
# "fine" refers to asphalt created from fine-graded mix.
# "dense" refers to asphalt created from coarse-graded mix,
#   and therefore appears more water-permeable on the surface.
# "gravel" refers to gravel road such as bridleway /private residence access road that is unpaved.
#   concrete/brick paving grading:
#       0: dry. May be sandy but the sand is dry too.
#       1: darkened but dry enough to roll over without leaving a print on the wheel.
#       2: darkened and vegetations/mud covering it are wet. May be covered with standing water.
#       3: visible water gleaming, possibly muddy. Runoff possible.
#   asphalt (fine) grading:
#       0: original colour & dry.
#       1: darkened, potholes filled with 0% water.
#       2: darkened, potholes filled with 100% water. Water on top is at a standstill.
#       3: darkened, potholes filled with 100% water. Water on top is 100% moving (runoff).
#   asphalt (coarse) grading:
#       0: original colour & dry,
#       1: darkened, potholes filled with 0% water.
#       2: darkened, potholes filled with 100% water. Water on top is at a standstill.
#       3: darkened, potholes filled with 100% water. Water on top is 100% moving (runoff).
#   gravel road grading:
#       0: gravel is dry, sandy.
#       1: sand is soggy and sticks to wheels lightly. Gravel is dry.
#       2: sand is soggy and sticks to wheels heavily. Gravel is soggy too.
#           Standing water in puddles at places.
#       3: muddy with mounts of mud piling up at places.
# These four grades roughly translates to:
#       0: dry
#       1: wet (no print)
#       2: wet (leaves print, minimal splashing, small drag due to splashing)
#       3: wet (            heavily splashing, significant drag due to splashing)
